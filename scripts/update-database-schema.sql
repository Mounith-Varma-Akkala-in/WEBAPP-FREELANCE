 '# Introduction to JavaScript

JavaScript is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat.

## History of JavaScript

JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich while he was an engineer at Netscape. JavaScript was first released with Netscape 2 early in 1996. It was originally going to be called LiveScript, but it was renamed in an ill-fated marketing decision that attempted to capitalize on the popularity of Sun Microsystem''s Java language â€” despite the two having very little in common. This has been a source of confusion ever since.

## Features of JavaScript

- **Lightweight**: JavaScript is a lightweight programming language.
- **Interpreted**: JavaScript is an interpreted language, not a compiled language.
- **Object-Oriented**: JavaScript is an object-oriented language.
- **First-class Functions**: In JavaScript, functions are first-class objects, i.e., they can be passed as arguments to other functions.
- **Case Sensitive**: JavaScript is case sensitive. For example, "myVariable" and "myvariable" are different variables.

## Setting Up Your Environment

You can run JavaScript in:
- **Browser Console**: Press F12 and go to Console tab
- **Online Editors**: CodePen, JSFiddle, or Repl.it
- **Text Editor**: VS Code with Live Server extension

## What You''ll Learn Next

In the upcoming lessons, we''ll cover:
- Variables and data types
- Functions and scope
- DOM manipulation
- Events and user interaction
- Modern JavaScript features

 '# Variables and Data Types in JavaScript

Variables are containers for storing data values. Think of them as labeled boxes where you can put different types of information! ðŸ“¦

## Declaring Variables

In JavaScript, there are three ways to declare variables:

### 1. `let` - Block Scoped (Recommended)
```javascript
let userName = "Alice";
let age = 25;
